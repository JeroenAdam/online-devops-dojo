## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo** module on shifting security left.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the "Shift Left on Security" module is to help you to understand the principles and benefits of Shifting Left on Security. This is to enable you and your team to Shift Left on Security in your daily work.

The secondary objective is to give you an opportunity to complete a Shift Left on Security real world scenario using Katacoda in **your** Sandbox environment.

Remember the Sandbox is your personal clone of the Pet Clinic Repository. The Sandbox is the one which you created in the Welcome module. You are free to experiment in your Sandbox without fear of impacting the lab or other learners.

If you have not completed the Welcome module you should do so before continuing with the Shift Left On Security module.

By the end of the lesson, you should be able to:

* articulate the need to Shift Left on Security,
* integrate Security Testing in the daily work of the scrum team as part of a CI/CD pipeline,
* describe how to reduce surface areas of risk and enforce consistency in the the application of security testing,
* understand the need to provide traceability of production artifacts,
* explain the importance of using commercially available and/or open source tools which the security team have reviewed and tools rather than custom solutions for security testing.
